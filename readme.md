# Gif Search

Designed by Kyle Peeler

## Overview

My second coding project: a gif search website designed to use the giphy API to
display gifs on a web page designed with custom css.

 Used to learn and display
knowledge of JavaScript, Jquery, and CSS.

## Details

- Contains a navbar with links to elements within the webpage.
- Search form uses Jquery to search the Giphy API for the provided search term.
Search term is then displayed on the web page.
- Search results are displayed in columns using custom CSS flexbox layout.
- When an image is clicked on, a link to the image is copied to the clipboard.
- on devices 320px and lower the website is changed to a column display and
element sizes are changed to ensure readability and reactive function.

## Usage

Source code hosted at <https://github.com/Kpeeler51/Gif-Search-Website>

Gitpub Pages website hosted at <https://kpeeler51.github.io/Gif-Search-Website/>

Type a search term into the search bar and hit submit. then a collection of gifs will appear.
Click on a gif and a link to the gif will be copied to the clipboard.
Email address and website link are examples and do not work.

## Technologies Used

HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery

## Future improvements

A page system to allow displaying more and diversified search results.

A better and less intrusive notification when a gif is copied to the clipboard.

Better inline display of gifs that are not multiples of four.
